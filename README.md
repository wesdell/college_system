## Analysis

### Main Entities

- `Student`: Identified by ID and enrollment, linked to a faculty.
- `Professor`: Assigned to subjects and courses, belongs to a faculty.
- `Subject`: Carries code, name, credits, and is taught through courses.
- `Course`: A parallel of a subject, with schedule, room, modality, and a professor.
- `Grade`: Assigned once per student-course relationship.
- `Enrollment`: Records subjects a student registers per term.
- `Faculty`: Groups subjects, professors, and students.

### Business Rules

| ID  | Rule                                                                 |
|-----|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| R1  | A student cannot register for the same subject in multiple courses. |
| R2  | A professor cannot be assigned to overlapping course schedules.     |
| R3  | A subject must have at least one active course.                     |
| R4  | Enrollment requires valid subject and course.                       |
| R5  | Each student-course has exactly one grade.                          |
| R6  | Students or subjects with active dependencies cannot be deleted.    |
